            Welcome to California’s statewide dashboard for transit passenger
            information quality. This tool is created and managed by the <a href="https://www.calitp.org/">California
                Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP)</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/programs/rail-and-mass-transportation"> Caltrans’ Division of Rail and Mass Transportation</a>,
            to make travel simpler and more cost-effective for everyone.

        <p>
            A key Caltrans objective is helping transit riders plan their trips
            using data that is both complete and accurate. While transit data comes
            in many forms, only one format—the General Transit Feed Specification
            (GTFS)—lets any new or existing app easily consume and publish transit
            data for riders. Cal-ITP has created this data dashboard with support from DRMT to help ensure
            that your GTFS data quality will meet your riders’ expectations for
            convenience and reliability, and the GTFS standard.

            <h2 id="quality">About GTFS data quality</h2>
            <p>
                Anyone planning a transit journey through their favorite trip planning
                application is almost certainly using GTFS data. Transit providers can
                publish this format to describe where their vehicles are supposed to go,
                when they’re supposed to get there, and where they actually are in real
                time, as well as other useful information like whether vehicles accept
                bicycles or what it will cost to board. Trip planning applications like
                Google Maps and the Transit App turn this information into a
                user-friendly experience for transit riders. But if there are unexpected
                issues with that data, the rider may get incorrect information—or none
                at all.

            <p>
                To help detect issues with transit data, MobilityData, which maintains the GTFS
                standard, manages an open-source GTFS validator. This validator, used by
                Google Maps and other major trip planning services, represents a wide
                range of potential issues. Cal-ITP deployed its own instance of the
                validator for the benefit of all California transit providers. Each
                month, Cal-ITP will run the validator on every California transit
                provider’s GTFS feeds and compile results into a PDF report.
            </p>

            <p>
                A complete archive of these reports is available in the directory.
                Transit providers and their vendors can also request that these monthly
                reports be automatically sent to them via email by contacting our GTFS
                Helpdesk at GTFSRT@dot.ca.gov.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Each report contains three sections:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A summary of the service operations represented in the most recent
                    version of your published GTFS feed. This identifies operations that have
                    been miscoded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A list of validation issues identified by the canonical GTFS
                    Validator. Each error and warning references this set of
                    validation rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A check for files and fields that are recommended by the GTFS Best
                    Practices and California Minimum GTFS Guidelines. If data is
                    missing, ask your vendor if they have plans to include this data. If
                    they don’t, contact the Cal-ITP Helpdesk (GTFSRT@dot.ca.gov)
                    for support.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                These reports are intended to be shared with vendors and provide
                actionable guidance for them to improve the data they produce on
                riders' behalves.
            </p>

            <h2 id="not-listed">I’m a California transit provider and I don’t see my brand listed here</h2>
            <p>
                GTFS Schedule data currently can only represent fixed-route and
                fixed-schedule transit operations, so entirely on-demand services such
                as paratransit will not be listed on this dashboard. If you represent a
                California transit provider with fixed route and fixed schedule service
                with a GTFS feed that is missing from this list, please send the stable
                URL for your GTFS Schedule data to the Cal-ITP Helpdesk at
                GTFSRT@dot.ca.gov. If you’re a California transit provider that wants GTFS data
                but doesn’t have it, or have related questions, you can contact the Helpdesk to
                take advantage of our available technical services.
