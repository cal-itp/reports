## User stories

A user story is implemented as well as it is communicated.
If the context and the goals are made clear, it will be easier for everyone to implement it, test it, refer to it.

### Summary

A user story should typically have a summary structured this way:

1. **As a** [user or stakeholder type]
2. **I want** [some software feature]
3. **So that** [some business value]


[
The user story should have a reason to exist: what do I need as the user described in the summary?
This part details any detail that could not be passed by the summary.
]
