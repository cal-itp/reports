        Welcome to California’s statewide dashboard for transit passenger
        information quality. This tool is created and managed by the California
        Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), an initiative of Caltrans’ Division
        of Rail and Mass Transportation to make travel simpler and more
        cost-effective for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        A key component of Cal-ITP is helping transit riders plan their trips
        using data that is both complete and accurate. While transit data comes
        in many forms, only one format—the General Transit Feed Specification
        (GTFS)—lets any new or existing app easily consume and publish transit
        data for riders. Cal-ITP has created this data dashboard to help ensure
        that your GTFS data quality will meet your riders’ expectations for
        convenience and reliability.

    <h2 id="quality">About GTFS data quality</h2>
    <p>
        Anyone planning a transit journey through their favorite trip planning
        application is almost certainly using GTFS data. Transit providers can
        publish this format to describe where their vehicles are supposed to go,
        when they’re supposed to get there, and where they actually are in real
        time, as well as other useful information like if vehicles accept
        bicycles or what it will cost to board. Trip planning applications like
        Google Maps and the Transit App turn this information into a
        user-friendly experience for transit riders. But if there are unexpected
        issues with that data, the rider may get incorrect information—or none
        at all.

        about what Caltrans considers good GTFS data and why.
    </p>


    <h2 id="how-to-website">How to use this website</h2>
    <p>
        To help detect such issues, MobilityData, which maintains the GTFS
        standard, manages an open-source GTFS validator. This validator, used by
        Google Maps and other major trip planning services, represents a wide
        range of potential issues. Cal-ITP has deployed its own instance of the
        validator for the benefit of all California transit providers. Each
        month, Cal-ITP will run the validator on every California transit
        provider’s GTFS feeds and compile results into a PDF report.
    </p>

    <p>
        A complete archive of these reports is available in the directory.
        Transit providers and their vendors can also request that these monthly
        reports be automatically sent to them via email by contacting our GTFS
        Helpdesk at GTFSRT@dot.ca.gov.

    <p>
        Each report contains three sections:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            A summary of the service operations represented in the most recent
            version of the GTFS feed. This identifies operations that have
            been miscoded.
        </li>
        <li>
            A list of validation issues identified by the canonical GTFS
            Validator. Each error and warning references this set of
            validation rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            A check for files and fields that are recommended by the GTFS Best
            Practices and California Minimum GTFS Guidelines. If data is
            missing, ask the vendor if they have plans to include this data. If
            they don’t, contact the Cal-ITP Helpdesk (GTFSRT@dot.ca.gov)
            for support.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        These reports are intended to be shared with vendors and provide
        actionable guidance for them to improve the data they produce on
        California’s behalf.
    </p>

    <h2 id="not-listed">I’m a California transit provider and I don’t see my brand listed here</h2>
    <p>
        GTFS Schedule data currently can only represent fixed-route and
        fixed-schedule transit operations, so entirely on-demand services such
        as paratransit will not be listed on this dashboard. If you represent a
        California transit provider with fixed route and fixed schedule service
        with a GTFS feed that is missing from this list, please send the stable
        URL for your GTFS Schedule data to the Cal-ITP Helpdesk at
        GTFSRT@dot.ca.gov. If you’re a California agency that wants GTFS data
        but doesn’t have it, or have related questions, contact the Helpdesk to
        take advantage of our available technical services.
